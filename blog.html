    <h1 class="post1-heading">My Journey in Frontend Development</h1>
    <p class="post1-desc">If someone had told me a couple of years ago that I’d be spending hours figuring out why a single div wasn’t aligning properly, I probably would’ve laughed. Yet here I am — knee-deep in code, colors, and endless “refresh-and-check” cycles, and honestly? I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

        <h3>Where it all began ~</h3>
        <p>It started with a simple question: “How do people even make websites?”<br>I’ve always admired clean, interactive web pages, but I never imagined I’d be building them myself. One day, I finally opened my laptop, searched for “how to build a website,” and was instantly drawn in. HTML and CSS were my first tools — and the first time I made a basic webpage, even with just a heading and a button, I felt like I had created magic.</p>

        <h3>The Struggles (and small victories) ~</h3>
        <p>Of course, the honeymoon phase didn’t last long. Enter JavaScript — my first real challenge. Suddenly, my neat little static pages needed life. DOM manipulation, events, and those dreaded bugs had me questioning my decision more than once. But every small victory, like making a button actually do something, kept me going.</p>

    <h3>Projects that made it real ~</h3>
        <p>Practise turned out to be the best teacher.
           <li>A job application form – my first proper project where I learned how structure and design come together.</li>
           <li>An Airbnb clone – the project that taught me patience (and the importance of responsiveness!).</li>
           <li>This blog – a space where I share my progress and reflect on how far I’ve come.</li>
           <br>
           Each project brought me one step closer to understanding that frontend development isn’t just about code — it’s about creating experiences.

        <h3>Lessons along the way ~</h3>
        <p>Patience is everything. Debugging is part of the process, not a setback.Learning never really stops. There’s always a new framework, a new challenge. Creativity matters as much as logic. It’s not just about making something work — it’s about making it beautiful and intuitive.</p>

        <h3>Looking Ahead ~</h3>
        <p>Today, I’m still learning and exploring — diving deeper into frameworks like React and understanding what makes a website fast, responsive, and delightful to use.
      <br>
      This journey hasn’t just taught me to code; it has taught me resilience, problem-solving, and the joy of building something from scratch. And if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: every error, every bug, and every “why isn’t this working?!” moment is a step forward
